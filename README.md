# Reader for Telegram

I use Telegram for almost all of my communications, and it is extremely helpful to have all of my RSS feeds in once place! However, the existing bots are not fast at updating, so I decided to make my own! And while I am here, why not try a new language?

Do note this is not done yet, so don't judge me

## Cool stuff

- Just paste in a feed and it's added. No sweat.
- Adjustable refresh rates (if some feeds update faster than others)
- Bot is just fast.
- Written in Go, so it is Google Approved™️
